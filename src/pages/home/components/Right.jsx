            <p>This paragraph does not apply to deposits at a Quebec branch.</p>
            <p>A GIC account with more than one owner has a right of survivorship attached to it. This means that where
                there are more than one of you, and one of you dies, the remaining one or more of you automatically become(s) the registered owner or owners of the GIC deposits. If one of you dies: (a) we depend on the others
                to let us know; (b) we will change our records to show that the survivor or survivors own all the GIC deposits
                placed under that account; (c) the survivor or survivors may either leave the deposit as it is until its term ends
                or request that we pay the deposit and any interest to you.</p>
