            <h2 className='font-bold text-lg'>What This Agreement Covers</h2>
            <p>This Agreement sets out the terms under which you can place aGIC deposit with us. Itreplaces all earlier Digital
                Commerce BankClientAgreements forGuaranteed Investment Certificates.When this Agreement refers to you it
                means any person in whose name a GIC is held.</p>
            <p>If you hold a GIC with others, you means each of you and all of you are individually and together agreeing to all
                of the terms of this Agreement.</p>
            <p>When this Agreement refers to we, our and us, it means Digital Commerce Bank Canada, and any other DBC
                company that accepts a GIC deposit from you. Placing your GIC deposit with us means that you have received
                and read this Agreement and agree to its terms.</p>
            <h2 className='font-bold text-lg'>Account Ownership and Signing Authority</h2>
            <p>When you open a GIC account with us, you tell us the names of the owners of the account. Any GIC deposits
                placed under that GIC account will be held in the names of the owner(s) of that account. You also tell us who
                has signing authority for the account. If you hold a GIC account with others you may tell us that you want any
                of you to have signing authority on the account. This means that any one of you can withdraw money from
                deposits under that account, make any changes we permit you to make to a GIC deposit, and give any other
                GIC instructions to us without telling the others. If you tell us that all of you are to sign on the account, all your
                signatures will be required in order to withdraw money or do anything else with the account. The information
                about ownership and signing authority, is set out on your GIC account signature card.</p>
            <p>You may also open a new GIC account over the Internet if you have a personal deposit account with us. If you
                do, the information about ownership and signing authority set out on the signature card for your personal
                deposit account will also apply to your GIC account.</p>
            <h2 className='font-bold text-lg'>Confirmation Notice</h2>
            <p>We will provide you with a confirmation notice once we have accepted a GIC deposit from you. It shows the
                details of the deposit, such as its principal amount, its term, the rate of interest and any instructions on what
                to do at maturity. It also shows whether you may cash the deposit before the end of its term and any penalties
                that may apply if you do so.</p>
            <h2 className='font-bold text-lg'>Payments and Renewals</h2>
            <p>You will tell us to pay the interest on a GIC deposit to you periodically or to keep it with the deposit. We will
                pay you the principal and any interest we have been keeping on the deposit at the end of its term, or renew it,
                if you tell us to do so.</p>
            <h2 className='font-bold text-lg'>Interest</h2>
            <p>Interest on a GIC deposit will be calculated counting the first but not the last day of the deposit’s
                term.</p>
            <h2 className='font-bold text-lg'>Payment and Renewal Instructions</h2>
            <p>You may provide us with instructions for payments of interest or principal and interest or to renew a deposit,
                by writing to us, speaking to one of our representatives at the branch where your account is located or contacting us by phone or over the Internet. To be effective, we must receive instructions at least 7 days before a
                scheduled payment.</p>
            <h2 className='font-bold text-lg'>Automatic Renewal</h2>
            <p>We will automatically renew a GIC at the end of its term, if you have not told us what to do with it. It will be for
                a one year term or the same term as the original deposit, whichever is less. The interest rate on the renewed
                deposit will be the same as the interest rate we offer on comparable deposits at the date of renewal. If you
                purchased your original GIC online or updated renewal instructions online, it may include any online special
                and/or bonus rate offered at the time of renewal, if applicable. The other details of the renewed deposit will be
                the same as the original deposit. If the deposit is no longer offered, we will renew it as a one year redeemable
                GIC. You have the right to cancel a renewed GIC within 10 business days from the issuance (renewal) date and
                if you do, your principal will be returned, but no interest will apply from the issuance to the cancellation date.</p>
            <h2 className='font-bold text-lg'>Transfer</h2>
            <p>Some GIC deposits can be transferred to a new owner, others cannot be. If you ask us, we will tell you whether
                your GIC deposit can be transferred and what you must do to transfer it to someone else or give it as security.
                If your GIC deposit cannot be transferred you cannot give it as security to anyone except us.</p>
            <p>Once a GIC deposit has been transferred by you, we will treat the new owner as if he, she or they were you, for
                all purposes of this Agreement</p>
            <p>We may apply a deposit against any amounts you owe us, without notice to you. If there are more than one of
                you, we may apply a deposit held by you against any amounts any one of you owes to us without notice to any
                of you.</p>
            <h2 className='font-bold text-lg'>Deposit Insurance Notices</h2>
            <p>The Digital Commerce Bank Canada and our affiliates are members of Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation
                (CDIC). A GIC deposit with any of these institutions is eligible for CDIC deposit insurance coverage provided
                it is made in Canadian dollars payable in Canada, for a term not exceeding 5 years and the total deposits you
                hold do not exceed $100,000 per institution per insurance category.</p>
